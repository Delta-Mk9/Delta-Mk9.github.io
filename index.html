                <h2>Hi, I am Eddie</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a tech enthusiast, web developer, and believer of open source and privacy.

                <h2>Technolofy is Life</h2>

                <h3>It all started with a 7 inch Android tablet</h3>
                <p>
                    Around 2014 (ballpark), an used android tablet was given to me by my older cousin,<br/>
                    the device itself was not impressive even at that time, with below than average specs,<br/>
                    but it was what exposed me to the world of information technology, the beginning of my journey.<br/>
                    Througout the years, I have dedicated myself to technology, and became who I am today.
                </p>

                <h3>Android, iOS, Windows, Linux</h3>
                <p>
                    As a tech enthusiast, I have learnt my way throughout different operating systems,<br/>
                    I am mainly Android and Windows user, occasionally using iPadOS for casual usage,<br/>
                    and trying out Linux distros in Oracle VirtualBox as my hobby.
                </p>

                <h3>Daily Drivers</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently using:<br/>
                    > Samsung S23 FE<br/>
                    > Samsung A33 (secondary/working phone)<br/>
                    > iPad mini 6<br/>
                    > Dell Insipron 16
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>A Web Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    This website is coded by yours truly!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Internet, Choices, Privacy & Security</h2>

                <h3>Right to Privacy</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe that privacy is a basic need for everyone, without privacy, there will be no freedom in speech, security and democracy.
                </p>

                <h3>Open Source</h3>
                <P>
                    While not every software is suitable to be made open sourced, it is one of the easiest way to be transparent to the public,<br/>
                    and earning trust in return, as it allows the code to be inspected and audited independently.
                </P>

                <h3>Recommendations</h3>

                <h3>Do No Evil</h3>
                <p>
                    As a developer, I feel that it's a responsibility for us developers to handle user data with extreme care, <br/>
                    by using E2EE encryption, never sell nor share user data to third party, or go as far as to not collect any user data at all.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Proudly support LGBT Community</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Misc</h2>

                <h3>Procedural generation</h3>
                <p>
                    While I am not a game developer, I do play games during my free time, and I am obsessed with procedural generation, because it significantly increase the replayability of a game.
                </p>

                <h3>Favorite games</h3>
                <p>
                    Minecraft<br/>
